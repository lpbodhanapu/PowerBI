This Power BI report provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix content.
Dataset: Netflix titles metadata from Kaggle 
Data is ingested and transformed using Power Query.
The following transformations were applied to clean and standardize the data:
•	Promoted first row as headers
•	Enforced correct data types
•	Extracted text before delimiters to normalize categorical values
•	Reordered columns for readability
•	Replaced inconsistent or missing values
•	Added conditional columns for classification logic
•	Converted text fields to lowercase to avoid duplicate categories
•	Renamed columns for clarity
•	Removed unnecessary columns
•	Filtered rows to keep relevant records only
These steps ensure consistent categorization, clean dimensions, and accurate aggregations.
